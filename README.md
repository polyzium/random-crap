# Random crap
Random stuff that I made for myself, now available to everyone.

Please note that this is pretty much raw unrefined code, I didn't take my time to optimize nor refactor it. Everything here is released as-is.

There's also no documentation whatsoever besides usage instructions in some of the Python scripts. you have to look into the source yourself.
